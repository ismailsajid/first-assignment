            <p class="banner-description">Sometime in the near future I hope to become a developer, I’m still not sure what I’d like to help with yet though. I’d also like to become a package maintainer for some curses based programs I’d like to see in ubuntu. I'd also like to see the California Loco team thrive. I think we've got some good direction and energy currently and I hope it continues to grow and develop.    </p>

            <h1>Why Web Development</h1>
            <p>Web developers provide businesses with the unique, engaging websites they need to connect with customers. While businesses could feasibly create their own sites using Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress templates, these tend to look amateurish and run slowly compared to sites built by professional Web Developers</p>
