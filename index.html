            <p class="banner-description">Sometime in the near future I hope to become a developer, I’m still not sure what I’d like to help with yet though. I’d also like to become a package maintainer for some curses based programs I’d like to see in ubuntu. I'd also like to see the California Loco team thrive. I think we've got some good direction and energy currently and I hope it continues to grow and develop.    </p>
